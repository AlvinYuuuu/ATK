1. Scope of the Services

1.1 ​As a Standing Offer Agreement (SOA) Contractor in Category A Major Group, you are invited to provide the System Design (“SD”), System Implementation &Integration (“SI&I") and System Maintenance & Support ("SM&S”) services of the Data Extraction and Searching System of Town Planning Board (TPB) / Planning Committee (PC) Papers and Minutes (“the System”) with associated Data Preparation Service ("the Service”) for the Planning Department (“PlanD”) of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ("HKSARG” or “the Government”) of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter collectively known as "the Project").
1.2 ​Unless otherwise defined in this Brief, all terms and expressions defined in the Tender for the Supply of Information Technology Professional Services to Government Departments (Tender Ref: GCIO90525965) (“SOA-QPS5”) shall have the same meanings when used herein.
1.3 ​The work assignment is a fixed cost project and is subject to the prevailing terms and conditions in the Conditions of Individual Contract (Part IV of SOA-QPS5). The tentative start date of the work assignment is August 2025 and is planned to be completed in 14 months including 3 months of nursing .
1.4 ​The work assignment requires mandatory SM&S services for the first 12 months and optional SM&S services for the second, third, fourth and fifth 12 months to the System. The tentative start date of the SM&S for the System is October 2026, upon completion of the nursing services.
1.5 ​The total price quoted in Price Proposal should exceed HK$3 million and not exceed HK$20 million.
 

2. Project Background
2.1 ​TPB is a statutory body established under section 2 of the Town Planning Ordinance (TPO) to, inter alia, consider planning applications under TPO.
2.2 ​PlanD is the executive arm of TPB providing secretariat services, assisting TPB to process each planning application received and providing TPB with all relevant information for it to make a decision on the application. From 1990 to 2024, there were about 60,000 planning applications received.
2.3  ​Upon receipt of an application, PlanD would publish the application for public comments and seek views of government bureaux/departments (B/Ds). PlanD would prepare a paper consolidating the details of the submission, the presence of any previous and/or similar applications in the area, the departmental views and public comments on the application, as well as PlanD's assessment of the planning application for the consideration of TPB.
2.4 ​TPB would then hold a meeting to consider the application taking into account the information submitted by the applicant,the departmental views and public comments received, PlanD's assessment, and any other relevant consideration before making a decision on the application/representation. The deliberation of TPB and its decision would be recorded in the minutes of TPB/PC meeting.
2.5​From 1990 to 2016, the TPB/PC Papers and minutes are in textual format (PDF or Word document) and are neither digitised (some are in hard copy) nor structuralised. It is not possible at the moment to search for TPB/PC Papers and minutes according to certain attributes such as the zoning, site area, proposed use, proposed building height, etc. Moreover, the concerns and enquiries of TPB Members on various planning applications can only be extracted manually. The very limited search function makes it difficult for a user to carry out a general search on applications, say, of a certain site area range or a particular type of land use; and implies a dearth of statistics on historical planning application data which hinders the research on similar/previous cases that often is a consideration taken into account by TPB.
2.6 ​In view of the current inadequate digitalised and structuralised data stated above, it is essential to create a comprehensive digitised database of TPB/PC Papers and minutes to facilitate searching and analysis of planning information.
Version 1.0 June 2025 Page 2
3. Project Objectives
3.1 The objectives of this work assignment are:

a. to digitize hard-copies and scanned-copies of TPB/PC Papers and minutes into machine-readable formats;
b. to design and develop a new System with application of Artificial Intelligence (A.I) technology for extracting data from TPB/PC Papers and meeting minutes (including both historical and new documents);
c. to establish a comprehensive digitized database and a central document repository for TPB/PC Papers and minutes, covering the period from 1990 to present;
d. to integrate the new system with existing IT systems in PlanD, enhancing search functionality for planning applications;
e. to complete system design, development, testing, and live implementation;
f. to provide user support, maintain the System, and ensure reliable and satisfactory performance to meet the service level requirements; and
g. to update the system documentation to reflect the latest production system.
 

3.2 At the end of the work assignment,the System (including the hardware, software and procedures documentation) should be ready for use by PlanD.

Combined System Development Services of Data Extraction and Searching System of TPB/PC Papers and Minutes for the Planning Department
7. Execution Plan

OneConnect Smart Technology Co., Limited (OneConnect) is pleased to present this detailed Execution Plan for the Provision of the Combined System Development Services of Data Extraction and Searching System of TPB/PC Papers and Minutes. This plan is built upon the comprehensive solution architecture and serves as our firm commitment to delivering a state-of-the-art, compliant, and future-ready system for the Planning Department (PlanD).

Our plan is meticulously designed to address every requirement outlined in the Brief of Work Assignment (the "Brief"), focusing on a seamless, parallel implementation of Part 1 (System Development) and Part 2 (Data Preparation). We will leverage our deep expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI), including advanced Vision Models, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), to not only meet the immediate objectives but also to establish a foundational, high-quality data asset that will empower PlanD's future AI and data analytics initiatives.

This Execution Plan details our proposed solution, its inherent compatibility and flexibility, our robust system integration strategy, and our comprehensive project management methodology, ensuring a successful, on-time, and on-budget delivery.

Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is an end-to-end, integrated system designed to transform PlanD's vast repository of historical and current TPB/PC papers and minutes from unstructured documents into a structured, searchable, and intelligent database. The solution addresses both the one-off data conversion challenge and the ongoing need for an intelligent extraction and analysis platform.

The core of our solution is a sophisticated AI-driven workflow, as illustrated in the Solution Overview. This workflow consists of three main stages:

1. Access & Document Processing: Securely ingesting documents (hardcopy scans, PDF, DOC/DOCX) and applying our advanced AI Vision Models and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. This initial step performs layout analysis to segment pages, identify tables, and handle degraded documents, ensuring high-quality input for extraction.
2. Data Extraction & Validation: Leveraging a powerful combination of NLP, LLMs, and pattern recognition, the system will automatically extract key metadata, simple fields (e.g., Application No.), and complex, narrative fields (e.g., Departmental Comments, Planning Considerations). A Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interface is integrated for quality assurance, allowing operators to verify and refine AI-extracted data, ensuring the highest level of accuracy.
3. Analytics & Export: The structured data is stored in a centralized database, accessible through a user-friendly interface. The system provides powerful search capabilities, GenAI-powered summarization, sentiment analysis of public comments, and predictive analytics, with options to export structured data for further use.
This solution will be delivered through two parallel workstreams as required:

● Part 1 - Implementation of the Data Extraction and Searching System: The design, agile development (SD & SI&I), and ongoing support (SM&S) of the core software platform.
● Part 2 - Data Preparation Services: The on-site scanning, OCR processing, and quality assurance to convert approximately 800,000+ pages of historical and recent documents into machine-readable format, feeding the System with high-quality, structured data.
Our approach ensures that the system is built and trained on the actual, prepared data concurrently, leading to a more robust, accurate, and rapidly deployed final product.



7.1 Implementation of Data Extraction and Searching System

Our proposed Data Extraction System is an government-grade, AI-powered platform designed from the ground up to address the unique complexities of Town Planning Board (TPB) and Planning Committee (PC) documentation. We propose a sophisticated, multi-modal, and hybrid technical architecture that leverages a "best-of-breed" strategy, selecting the most effective AI models for each specific task. This ensures we meet and exceed the stringent functional requirements outlined in Annex A and the detailed data schema.

Our solution is not a monolithic tool but an intelligent, adaptive engine that integrates state-of-the-art Vision Models, our proprietary high-accuracy OCR engine, and a powerful ensemble of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). This system will transform decades of diverse documents—from historical scanned papers to modern digital files—into a perfectly structured, queryable, and insightful database compliant with the Schema Table (s.12, s.16, and s.17 applications).

Proof of Concept: We’ve prepared a proof of concept to demonstrate our ability to conduct data extraction based on the schema set by PlanD: PlanD Demo 2.mp4



7.1.1 Multi-Modal Document Ingestion and Understanding
The cornerstone of our system is its ability to perceive and comprehend documents holistically, a capability that goes far beyond traditional OCR. By employing a "vision-first" strategy, we analyze the document's structure and layout before reading its content, preserving critical context that is otherwise lost.

7.1.1.1 The Vision-First Analysis Pipeline
Our system is architected to handle all specified document formats with precision:

● Initial Analysis with Advanced Vision Models: For every page, whether from a digital .PDF or a scanned image, we first employ a state-of-the-art vision model. Our strategy involves using leading open-source models like Qwen-VL, InternVL, or equivalent, selected and fine-tuned for their superior performance in document layout analysis. This vision model performs critical pre-processing segmentation, identifying and isolating distinct zones such as:
○ Structural Elements: Headers, footers, page numbers, and marginalia.
○ Textual Blocks: Main paragraphs, lists, and long-form text sections.
○ Complex Tables: Critically, this includes tables with or without borders and with merged cells, directly fulfilling the challenging requirement in Annex B, Req 2.13.
○ Ancillary Information: Handwritten notes, special characters like "✔" symbols, strikethroughs, and underlined words.
○ Visual Content: Captions associated with plans and drawings.
● High-Fidelity Text Recognition with Votee OCR: Once the document is intelligently segmented, each text block is processed by our proprietary Votee OCR engine. This engine is not a generic OCR tool; it has been specifically optimized for:
○ Bilingual Accuracy: Exceptional performance on both English and Traditional Chinese characters, essential for Hong Kong government documents.
○ Domain Specialization: Pre-trained on a vast corpus of administrative, legal, and technical documents, ensuring high accuracy on domain-specific terminology and abbreviations found in TPB papers.
This two-stage, vision-enhanced process guarantees that the output sent for extraction is not just a "wall of text," but a structurally understood representation of the original document.

 

7.1.1.2 High-Precision Metadata Recognition
Accurate metadata is the key to document retrieval and organization. As required by Annex A (Req 2.2.ii), our hybrid approach ensures maximum reliability for fields like app_no, app_type, authority, meeting_date, and meeting_no.

● Rule-Based Pattern Matching: For highly predictable formats (e.g., app_no format Y/XX/XXX), we use optimized regular expressions for instantaneous, high-precision extraction.
● LLM-Powered Contextual Validation: A Large Reasoning Model (Phi-4-mini or similar) acts as a validation layer. A newer and better model might be leveraged if there’s any when we kickstart the project, subject to further assessment. After the pattern matcher extracts "s.12A" for the app_type, the LLM scans the surrounding text for corroborating keywords ("rezoning," "amendment to plan," etc.) to confirm the classification, effectively eliminating false positives.
 

7.1.1.3 A Sophisticated Hybrid Extraction Engine
This is the core of our solution, where we intelligently map unstructured content to the structured fields of the Schema Table. We employ distinct strategies for simple and complex data types.

A. Simple Field and Structured Data Extraction
For quantifiable data, especially from tables detailing development parameters, our vision-first approach provides a decisive advantage.
● Intelligent Table Deconstruction: The vision model's output provides a perfect digital representation of the table's structure.
● Context-Aware Mapping: An LLM then "reads" this deconstructed table, correctly mapping labels to values and populating the schema. This ensures accurate extraction for:
○ site_area, govt_land_area, private_land_area (Entity 9)
○ total_pr, domestic_pr, non_domestic_pr (Entity 12)
○ total_gfa, domestic_gfa, non_domestic_gfa (Entity 13)
○ Proposed bh and sc (Entities 14 & 15)
B. Complex Field Extraction with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)
For fields requiring deep semantic comprehension, we will utilize a powerful LRM, such as the Phi-4-mini. A newer and better model might be leveraged if there’s any when we kickstart the project, subject to further assessment. These models excel at reasoning over long-form text, fulfilling the "Complex Data Extraction" requirements (Annex A, Req 2.2.iv).
● Deep Semantic Comprehension: The LRM reads and internalizes entire sections to extract the full substance of nuanced fields, including:
○ justifications_from_applicant (Entity 21): The model synthesizes all points of the applicant's argument into a coherent block.
○ planning_considerations (Entity 28): It identifies and extracts the complete narrative of the planning department's assessment.
○ amendments_notes_details (Entity 6): The LRM parses complex legal and technical sentences to precisely capture proposed changes to OZP Notes or the Explanatory Statement.
C. Natively Handling Data Variability and Multiple Entries
The Schema Table's "Remarks" column highlights the need for flexibility, a requirement our system handles natively as specified in Annex A (Req 2.2.iv).
● Structured Output for Multiple Entries: Our system is designed to recognize and structure one-to-many relationships. When multiple restrictions or parameters are present, the output is a structured JSON array, not a single concatenated string. This applies to:
○ Multiple zone or zone_subarea involvements (Entity 11, 11a).
○ Varying bh_restrict_val for building heights expressed in "m, mPD and no. of storeys" (Entity 11g, 14).
○ Multiple gic_type facilities (Entity 18).
○ Multiple prev_app_no entries (Entity 22).
This structured approach ensures the final database is programmatically clean, highly usable, and accurately reflects the source document's complexity.

 

7.1.1.4 Advanced Analytical Capabilities: Summarization and Sentiment
Our solution delivers more than extraction; it provides analytical insights crucial for understanding stakeholder perspectives.

● Abstractive Summarization: For fields like topic in Departmental Comments (26), Public Comments (27), and Members' Q&A (31), our LRM performs abstractive summarization. It generates a new, concise, and human-readable summary of the core issue, which is significantly more advanced than simply extracting keywords.
● Domain-Adapted Sentiment Analysis: Generic sentiment models fail on the nuanced language of planning. Our fine-tuned LRM is trained to understand and correctly classify the specific lexicon of TPB papers. It can accurately differentiate between:
○ Clear stances: "Support," "Object."
○ Nuanced non-opposition: It correctly interprets "No Adverse Comment," "No Objection," and "No in-principle Objection" as distinct forms of non-opposition, rather than misclassifying them as neutral. This directly addresses the predefined attributes for views in Entities 26, 27, and 32.
 

7.1.1.5 A Commitment to Excellence: Accuracy, Validation, and Continuous Improvement
We are fully committed to achieving and exceeding the minimum F1-score of 95% (Annex A, Req 2.2.x). Our methodology is built on a foundation of rigorous validation and a continuous learning architecture.

● Multi-Layered Validation: Extracted data is checked against schema rules (e.g., value ranges, predefined lists) and cross-validated for logical consistency.
● The Virtuous Feedback Loop (Human-in-the-Loop): Our UI enables System Operators to verify data with a "jump-to-PDF" source preview. Every operator correction is captured and converted into high-quality training data. This data is used to continuously fine-tune our entire model suite (Vision, OCR, and LRM), creating a system that learns and improves with every document it processes.
● Rigorous AI Evaluation and Reprocessing: We will strictly adhere to the evaluation protocol outlined in Annex A, Req 2.2.xi. We  will process the designated assessment batch for PlanD's detailed review. Should any batch fall short of the 95% accuracy target, our dedicated AI team will enhance the models and reprocess the entire batch at no additional cost, guaranteeing that all deliverables meet the required standard of excellence.
 

 



7.1.2 User Interface (UI) Features
7.1.2.1 A User-Centric and Role-Based Design Philosophy
Our proposed solution includes a sophisticated, intuitive, and robust User Interface (UI) designed to empower all user groups within PlanD. Built on a modern technology stack using .NET for the backend and Angular for the frontend, our UI will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, ensuring a responsive, scalable, and maintainable application.

Our design philosophy is centered on user efficiency and operational excellence. The UI will provide a seamless and intuitive experience, minimizing clicks and maximizing productivity by presenting the right information and tools to the right users at the right time.

7.1.2.2 Dedicated UIs for Operational Excellence
As required by Annex A (Req 2.2.xiv), our system will provide three distinct, role-based UIs, each tailored to the specific needs and workflows of its users.

○ System Monitoring: Dashboards for monitoring system performance and resource usage.
○ Audit Trail Viewer: A secure interface for reviewing detailed audit logs of all system and user activities.
7.1.2.3 Core Functionalities for Data Management and Review
Our UI is equipped with a comprehensive suite of features to ensure data integrity, facilitate collaboration, and streamline workflows.

● Intelligent Document Upload and Processing
Users can upload single or multiple documents in .PDF, .DOC, or .DOCX format. To fulfill the requirement of avoiding duplication, the system intelligently processes meeting minutes by checking key metadata (e.g., meeting_date, authority, meeting_no) upon upload to prevent the same minutes from being imported multiple times.
● Version Control and Data Integrity
As required by Annex A, our system will implement robust version control for both documents and their extracted data. Every edit made by a System Operator to the "raw data" is tracked, creating a complete version history. This ensures full traceability and accountability, protecting the integrity of the data and preventing inaccurate editions.
● Collaborative Tagging and Annotation
To enrich the dataset beyond the core schema, both System Operators and General Users will have the ability to tag additional information to extracted data. This feature allows users to add contextual notes, project identifiers, or cross-references, making the data more searchable and valuable over time. These tags will be indexed and searchable through the query interface.
7.1.2.4 Powerful Search and Analytical Capabilities
The true value of a structured database lies in its accessibility. Our UI provides powerful tools for data discovery and analysis.

● Advanced Query and Discovery Tools
The UI will feature a multi-faceted search engine that supports:
○ Profile Searches: Users can quickly find applications using key attributes like app_no, district_planning_office, or plan_no.
○ Content Searches: Full-text search capabilities allow users to search for keywords or phrases within long-form fields like justifications_from_applicant, amendments_notes_details, or public_comments.
○ Faceted Filtering: Search results can be dynamically refined using a combination of filters, allowing for complex sub-queries (e.g., "Show all s.12A applications in the 'Tuen Mun & Yuen Long West' district that involved 'Residential' zoning and were decided in 2023").
● Insightful Analytics and Reporting Dashboard
Directly addressing Annex A (Req 2.2.iv Complex), our system will provide functions to compile useful graphs, tables, and statistics. The General User UI will feature a dashboard that can answer typical questions with dynamic visualizations:
○ Application Statistics: Charts showing approval/rejection rates over time, broken down by application type.
○ Geographic Distribution: Maps and charts illustrating the distribution of applications by District or OZP.
○ Trend Analysis: Visualizations like WordClouds to show the most common "Applied Uses" or topics in public comments, and WordTrend graphs to see how their frequency changes over time.
7.1.2.5 Seamless Integration with Other PlanD Systems
The UI and its underlying backend are architected for interoperability. As required by Annex A (Req 2.2.xiii and 2.2.xiv), the UI will allow for future integration with other PlanD IT systems, including PARIS, CPDH, PDIP, TPB SPP3, and PWMS.

This is achieved through our RESTful API-first design. All UI functionalities are powered by well-documented APIs, which can be securely exposed to other systems during the System Enhancement stage, ensuring seamless data flow and a unified digital ecosystem for PlanD.


7.1.3 One-off Data Extraction Service

We will provide a comprehensive One-off Data Extraction Service utilizing our advanced data extraction system, tailored to process a total of 120,000 PDF files (comprising approximately 100,000 TPB papers and 20,000 minutes). Our system will be leveraged to efficiently extract data from the PDFs, ensuring it is accurately transcribed and formatted for subsequent use.

During this process, we will:

● Utilize the Data Extraction System: Our system, developed specifically for this task, will perform the extraction of structured data from the PDF files, ensuring it aligns with the required specifications.
● Data Patching and Cleansing: In the event that errors are identified during PlanD’s User Acceptance Test (UAT)—which involves sample checks on the extracted data—we will promptly perform data patching and cleansing. This will involve reviewing, correcting, and refining the extracted data to address any discrepancies, ensuring it meets the required standards and specifications before final delivery.
This one-off service is designed to not only extract the data but also ensure its quality and reliability through systematic review and corrections, guaranteeing that the final dataset is clean and accurate.

 

 



7.1.4 Non-Functional Features
Our Data Extraction System is built not only on powerful functional capabilities but also on a robust foundation of non-functional excellence. We are committed to delivering a system that is secure, reliable, scalable, and fully compliant with PlanD's established IT ecosystem and policies.

7.1.4.1 Authentication and User Control
Security and access control are paramount. Our system will implement a granular and secure authentication framework as required by Annex A (Req 2.3).

○ Document uploads and data extractions.
○ Every data creation, modification, or deletion action, capturing the "before" and "after" values.
○ User and role management changes.
● Detailed Log Information: Each audit log entry will contain critical information, including the user's identity, the precise date and time of the action, the action performed, and the user's IP address.
● Secure Access: The audit logs will be securely stored and accessible only to authorized System Administrators through a dedicated interface for review and troubleshooting.
7.1.4.3 Secure Network Connection and Data Encryption
We will implement end-to-end security to protect PlanD's data at all stages, fully complying with Annex A (Req 2.3).

● Data in Transit: All communications between the user's browser, the web server, and the backend services will be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. We will use SSL certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to secure the connection and protect data from eavesdropping.
● Data at Rest: All data stored within the system's database, including extracted information and user credentials, will be encrypted at rest using the industry-standard AES-256 encryption algorithm. This ensures that the data remains protected even in the unlikely event of unauthorized access to the physical storage.
● Data Purging: In line with security best practices and the requirements of Annex B, all source documents and their intermediate digital images used for OCR processing will be securely purged from our system's temporary storage once the extraction and verification process for a batch is complete and accepted by PlanD.
7.1.4.4 Frameworks and Technologies for Development
Our solution is built on a modern, robust, and open technology stack, adhering to the specifications in Annex A (Req 2.4).

7.3.4 System Architecture
The proposed solution is built upon a modern, multi-tier architecture specifically designed to align with the componentized infrastructure detailed in Appendix II. This service-oriented approach logically decouples the system's core functions, ensuring it operates seamlessly within PlanD’s secure and managed IT operational model. This modularity provides significant advantages in security, scalability, and maintainability, aligning perfectly with government IT standards.

The system's architecture is deployed across PlanD's specified server infrastructure as follows:

1. Presentation Tier (Web Server): The user interface is a pure client-side application built with Angular. It will be hosted on the designated Web Server using MS IIS. This tier is responsible for providing a responsive and intuitive interface for all user groups (System Operators, General Users, Administrators) and is completely decoupled from the backend business logic.
2. Application & Business Logic Tier (Web Server): The core business logic is encapsulated within a set of RESTful API services built on the .NET framework. Also running on the Web Server, this tier securely handles all user requests, enforces business rules, manages user sessions, and orchestrates the data flow between the user interface, the AI engine, and the database.
3. AI Processing Tier (Application Server with AI Engine): To handle the computationally intensive data extraction tasks, the Python-based AI Engine is deployed on the dedicated, high-performance Application Server with AI engine. This specialized server, equipped with NVIDIA A2/L20 GPUs, processes documents retrieved from the Document Management Server. This critical separation ensures that intensive AI workloads do not impact the performance or responsiveness of the user-facing application.
4. Data Tier (Database Server): All extracted "raw" and "refined" data is stored in the MS SQL 2022 Standard Edition database, which resides on the secure, dedicated Database Server. This tier serves as the permanent, structured repository of record, ensuring data integrity and fast query performance.
This deliberate, multi-tier design provides the following key benefits for PlanD:

● Enhanced Security: Each tier can be secured independently within PlanD's network. Communication between tiers occurs over secure, internal API calls, minimizing the attack surface and aligning with the Secure Network Connection with Encryption requirement (clause 2.3).
● Targeted Scalability: The architecture allows for independent scaling. If AI processing becomes a bottleneck, PlanD can scale up resources for the Application Server with AI engine without altering the web or database tiers, providing a highly efficient and cost-effective scaling model.
● Superior Maintainability and Resilience: The modular design allows for independent updates and maintenance. The UI can be updated without redeploying the AI models, and vice-versa. This separation also provides fault isolation—an issue in one tier is less likely to cause a catastrophic failure of the entire system, leading to higher overall availability.
Finally, OneConnect confirms that the entire solution is designed to be deployed within the distinct Development, Testing, and Production environments provided by PlanD, ensuring a standardized and reliable lifecycle from development to final operation.

● MVC Design Pattern: Both the API services and the web application structure will strictly adhere to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This separation of concerns is critical for long-term maintainability, allowing for independent modification of the data logic (Model), user interface (View), and application flow (Controller), which directly supports PlanD's ability to manage the system in the future.
7.3.5.4 Version Control Mechanism
To ensure full transparency and accountability throughout the project lifecycle, we will implement a robust version control system.

● System and Process: We will use a standard, industry-leading version control system such as Git. A private repository will be established to meticulously record all changes to the program's source code, from the initial commit to the final delivery.
● Supervision and Audit: This mechanism will provide PlanD's designated personnel with supervisory access to monitor development progress in near real-time. It creates a complete, unalterable history of the codebase, facilitating code reviews, ensuring quality, and providing a detailed audit trail for the entire application development process.

7.4 Flexibility

Our solution is architected for change. Flexibility is not an afterthought but a core design principle woven into the application's architecture, its integration capabilities, and our development methodology. This ensures the system can seamlessly adapt to PlanD's evolving business needs, new data formats, and future technological advancements, guaranteeing its long-term value and relevance. Our approach to flexibility is built on three distinct pillars, directly addressing the desirable features outlined in the Brief.

7.4.1 Application design flexibility
Application design flexibility is not an add-on; it is a foundational principle of our proposed solution, explicitly addressing the requirements for adaptability outlined in Annex A, clauses 2.2(v), 2.2(vi), and 2.2(xii). Our system is engineered to be modular, scalable, and adaptable, ensuring it can evolve with PlanD's future needs without requiring costly and disruptive redevelopment cycles.

We achieve this superior flexibility through three core design strategies:

7.4.1.1 Decoupled Multi-Tier Architecture for Component Independence
The system’s architecture is inherently modular, logically and physically decoupling the Presentation Tier (Angular UI), the Application Tier (.NET Backend & APIs), and the AI Processing Tier (Python AI Engine). These components communicate via secure, well-defined REST APIs.

How it Ensures Flexibility: This separation means a change in one component does not force a change in the others. For example, as AI technology evolves, the AI engine can be enhanced, retrained on new document formats, or even replaced with a more advanced model, without necessitating any redevelopment of the user interface or the underlying database. This directly fulfills the requirement in clause 2.2(xii) for a system that is "adaptable for ongoing data extraction of similar documents in the future."

7.4.1.2 Externalized Business Logic for User-Driven Adaptability
We will strictly adhere to the mandate in clause 2.2(vi) that "business-related information and logic should not be hardcoded into the programs."

How it Ensures Flexibility: Key business logic, extraction patterns, technical terminology lists, and abbreviations will be managed via external configuration files and a dedicated administrative UI. This is a critical flexibility feature that empowers authorized PlanD System Administrators or General Users to:

● Refine Extraction: Adjust regular expressions to capture new data formats.
● Update Terminology: Add new technical terms or common phrases to the recognition library.
● Manage Entities: Modify or add fields to the data schemas to accommodate changes in planning applications over time, as per clause 2.2(v).
This empowers PlanD to adapt the system to evolving requirements (e.g., a new land use classification or adjusting sentiment analysis rules for public comments) without developer intervention or a new code deployment cycle.

7.4.1.3 Independent Performance Scalability for Efficiency
The decoupled architecture allows each service to be scaled independently to meet performance demands, leveraging PlanD's virtualized infrastructure.

How it Ensures Flexibility: This ensures cost-effective and efficient resource management. If a large-scale data migration or the processing of a particularly complex batch of historical documents creates a performance bottleneck, the resources for the Application Server with AI engine can be scaled vertically (more CPU/GPU) or horizontally (more instances). This can be done without impacting the performance or cost of the web and database servers, which might be experiencing normal load.

7.4.2 Integration Flexibility
Our solution is architected to be more than a data extraction tool; it is designed as a future-proof data services hub for PlanD's entire application landscape. We achieve this through a rigorous API-First design philosophy, directly addressing the forward-looking integration requirements of Annex A, clause 2.2(xiii) and the technical specifications in clause 2.4.

7.4.2.1 API-First Architecture as a "Universal Adapter"

Our system is built using an API-first approach. This means the system's entire functionality—from querying extracted entities to retrieving document metadata—is exposed through a comprehensive, secure, and well-documented set of RESTful APIs.

● Technology & Standards: Conforming to clause 2.4, these APIs are built on the .NET framework and adhere to the MVC design pattern. They use industry-standard JSON for data interchange and will be fully documented using the OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger).
● Benefit for PlanD: This provides a standardized and flexible "front door" to the system's data and logic. Any other application, now or in the future, can interact with this API, effectively making it a universal adapter that simplifies integration and eliminates the need for complex, custom point-to-point connections.
7.4.2.2 Primed for Seamless Integration with PlanD's Ecosystem

This API-centric design makes it straightforward to connect our solution with the key systems identified in clause 2.2(xiii), transforming the extracted data into an active, enterprise-wide asset.

● How it Works (Examples):
○ PARIS: The Planning Application and Representation Information System could query our API to automatically populate or validate historical planning parameters for new applications.
○ PDIP & CPDH: The Planning and Development Information Portal and Core Planning Data Hub could consume our API to retrieve aggregated statistics (e.g., approval rates by district, common application types) for creating public-facing dashboards or internal analytical reports.
○ External Platforms: The standardized API facilitates integration with broader government initiatives like the Common Spatial Data Infrastructure (CSDI), allowing planning data to be overlaid and analyzed with other geospatial datasets.
● Benefit for PlanD: This approach dramatically reduces the development overhead and risk associated with future integration projects. Adding a new connection is a predictable, low-risk task, ensuring the system remains a relevant and valuable component of PlanD's digital transformation journey.



7.4.3 Development Flexibility
OneConnect adopts continuous delivery practices through our agile methodology to facilitate frequent and reliable software releases.

● Agile Scrum Framework: We will strictly adhere to the Agile Software Development approach as mandated by the Brief (4.1.2.h), employing the Scrum framework. This iterative process is a built-in mechanism for change, allowing requirements to be refined and priorities to be adjusted at the start of each Sprint. This methodology is purpose-built to manage the evolutionary nature of complex AI projects and provides a structured, transparent framework to accommodate scope modifications, including the estimated 30% potential changes mentioned in the Brief (4.2.e.ii).
● Continuous Delivery Practices: Our development cycle facilitates frequent and reliable releases by incorporating modern DevOps practices. Each Sprint includes not just development but also automated testing (unit, integration, and regression tests) and disciplined version control (Git). This ensures that every software increment delivered at the end of a Sprint is high-quality, stable, and ready for deployment, minimizing risk and maximizing reliability.




7.5 System Integration

We propose a tightly integrated, cohesive solution where all components—from the user interface to the AI models—work in concert to deliver a seamless user experience and robust, reliable performance. Our approach is integrated by design, utilizing a unified technology stack and a central API gateway to ensure that the system functions as a single, powerful whole, not a collection of disparate parts.



7.5.1 AI/ML Model Integration
Our solution delivers more than just a data extraction script; it provides a deeply integrated and flexible AI/ML framework designed for sustained, high-accuracy performance and future evolution, as mandated by Annex A, clause 2.2 and the technical specifications in clause 2.4.

7.5.1.1 Unified Technology Stack for Native Performance

Our strategic choice is to use Python for the AI Engine (as required by clause 2.4), leveraging its world-class ecosystem for data science. This approach eliminates the performance overhead and maintenance complexity associated with cross-language interfaces (e.g., bridging Java and Python).

● How it Works: This native integration allows us to seamlessly embed advanced libraries for every aspect of the extraction process directly within the application's processing pipeline:
○ Text Recognition & Layout Analysis: Advanced OCR and layout detection models to handle complex table structures (with/without borders, merged cells).
○ Named Entity Recognition (NER): Custom-trained models to precisely identify entities like Application No., GFA, Plot Ratio, and Site Area.
○ Text Classification & Sentiment Analysis: Sophisticated Transformer-based models (e.g., from Hugging Face) to comprehend long textual content and accurately classify the sentiment of "public comments" as "support," "object," or "providing views."
○ Summarization: Extractive and abstractive summarization models to condense "departmental comments" and "TPB members' deliberations."
7.5.1.2 Microservices Architecture for AI Model Deployment

To ensure the AI models are deployed as robust, scalable, and independently maintainable services, we will adopt a microservices architecture.

● Proposed Frameworks: We will use industry-best-practice frameworks such as FastAPI or Flask to wrap our trained models (e.g., the NER model, the summarization model) into lightweight, independent API endpoints.
● Benefits for PlanD:
○ Flexibility & Maintainability: Each AI function (e.g., table extraction, sentiment analysis) exists as a separate service. This means PlanD can update or retrain the sentiment analysis model without touching the table extraction model, significantly reducing risk and testing overhead.
○ Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently on the Application Server with AI engine. If summarizing long documents is computationally expensive, we can increase the instances of the summarization service alone, optimizing resource usage on the NVIDIA GPUs.
○ Production-Ready: These services will be containerized using Docker, making them portable and consistent across Development, Testing, and Production environments. This also prepares them for advanced MLOps deployment frameworks like Kubeflow or MLflow should PlanD adopt these standards in the future, ensuring long-term operational viability.
 




7.5.2 API Integration
Our solution is built upon a comprehensive, standardized, and secure API layer that serves as the central communication hub for the entire system. This API-First approach is fundamental to the system's modularity, security, and future extensibility, directly supporting the requirements of Annex A, clauses 2.3 and 2.4.

7.5.2.1 A Centralized "Nervous System" via RESTful APIs

A suite of RESTful APIs, built on the .NET framework and adhering to the MVC design pattern, will act as the "nervous system" of the application. These APIs are the sole authorized communication channel between the user interface, the backend logic, the MS SQL database, and the AI models.

● Security: This single-point-of-entry design is critical for security. All communications to and from the API layer will be protected with native encryption via TLS/SSL, as mandated in clause 2.3, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality over the network. Access to API endpoints will be governed by the authentication and authorization logic integrated with PlanD's Active Directory.
● Consistency: This architecture guarantees a consistent, secure, and well-defined data flow, preventing uncontrolled, direct access to the database or other backend components, which is a key principle of modern, secure application design.
7.5.2.2 Adherence to Industry-Standard Protocols and Documentation

To ensure standardization, interoperability, and smooth integration with other PlanD systems (PARIS, CPDH, etc.), we will strictly adhere to industry-best-practice protocols:

● API Specification: We will design and document all APIs using the OpenAPI Specification 3.0 (formerly Swagger). This provides machine-readable documentation that is both human-friendly and allows for the auto-generation of client code, drastically simplifying the process for other teams at PlanD to discover and consume our APIs.
● Data Interchange: We will use JSON as the standard data format for all API requests and responses, ensuring maximum compatibility with modern web applications and services.
● Error Handling: We will implement robust, standardized error-handling mechanisms. The API will use standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and consistent JSON error message formats. This makes the system's behavior predictable and significantly easier to debug for developers of both the UI and any integrating systems.
This disciplined approach ensures that the API layer is not just a technical component but a strategic asset that enhances security, simplifies maintenance, and provides a stable foundation for future system enhancements and cross-platform integrations.



7.5.3 Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration
Our solution is designed for deep, native integration with PlanD’s existing enterprise identity and access management infrastructure, ensuring a secure, seamless, and centrally managed user experience. This directly fulfills the Authentication and User Control requirements outlined in Annex A, clause 2.3.

7.5.3.1 Seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) Experience

The system will integrate directly with PlanD's Active Directory (AD) and/or Departmental Portal (DP) to provide a frictionless Single Sign-On (SSO) experience.

● User Experience: This means all authorized PlanD users will log in once using their standard government credentials. Upon successful authentication, they will gain immediate and secure access to the Data Extraction System without needing to remember or manage a separate password, thereby enhancing both security and user productivity.
● Centralized Control: This approach ensures that all user authentication is handled by PlanD's authoritative identity provider. User lifecycle management (e.g., onboarding, off-boarding, password resets) remains under the full control of PlanD's IT administrators, aligning with standard government security policies.
7.5.3.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Following successful authentication, our system will implement fine-grained authorization based on the user's role within PlanD. The system is designed to support the multiple user groups and privileges specified in the tender documents.

● Implementation: The application will map AD groups to the distinct system roles mentioned, such as:
○ System Administrator: Full administrative rights, including user privilege settings and system configuration.
○ System Operator: Rights to upload documents, initiate data extraction processes, and perform data patching/cleansing.
○ General User: Rights to view, search, query extracted data, and export results.
● These privilege settings will be modifiable for different user groups via a dedicated administrative interface within the system, allowing PlanD to adapt access rights as operational needs evolve.
7.5.3.3 Adherence to Standardized and Secure Protocols

To implement this integration, we will utilize modern, secure, and industry-standard authentication and authorization protocols.

● Proposed Protocols: Our primary approach is to use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), the modern standards for delegated authentication and identity federation. This is the most secure and flexible method for integrating with enterprise identity providers like AD (via ADFS or Azure AD) and other portal systems. If PlanD’s infrastructure requires a different approach, we are also fully capable of integrating via LDAP/LDAPS for direct directory lookups and authentication. The use of these standard protocols ensures robust, future-proof security and simplifies the integration process.
 


7.5.4 Application Integration
Beyond the specific integrations with PlanD applications, our solution is architected for broader interoperability across the HKSARG. We are committed to delivering a system that functions not as a data silo, but as a valuable and responsible node within the government's digital ecosystem. This commitment is realized by adhering to the principles and technical standards promoted by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).

7.5.4.1 Adherence to HKSAR Government Interoperability Frameworks

Our design choices are directly aligned with the HKSARG's technical architecture and interoperability guidelines.

● API-Centric Design: By building the system on a foundation of RESTful APIs using JSON for data exchange, we are complying with the de facto standard for modern government service integration. This ensures that any other government bureau or department can easily connect to and consume planning data from our system with minimal technical barriers.
● OpenAPI Specification: The use of the OpenAPI Specification for documenting our APIs aligns with best practices for creating discoverable and self-describing government data services, facilitating faster and more reliable integrations.
7.5.4.2 Readiness for Key Government Data Initiatives

The system is designed to be a "good citizen" in the HKSARG's digital ecosystem, primed for participation in key data-sharing initiatives.

● Common Spatial Data Infrastructure (CSDI): The structured, geo-referenced data extracted by our system (e.g., district, lot number, site area) can be readily exposed via our API. This makes it straightforward to integrate this valuable planning information as a data layer within the CSDI portal, enabling powerful cross-departmental spatial analysis.
● iAM Smart Integration: While the initial requirement is for AD/DP authentication, our use of standard protocols like OIDC means the system is architecturally ready to integrate with iAM Smart for public-facing access or authentication in the future, should PlanD choose to extend its services.
By embracing these open standards and forward-looking design principles, we deliver a solution that not only meets PlanD's immediate requirements but also provides a lasting asset that contributes to the broader vision of a more connected, data-driven, and efficient digital government.

Combined System Development Services of Data Extraction and Searching System of TPB/PC Papers and Minutes for the Planning Department
9. Project Management Plan

This Project Management Plan outlines the comprehensive framework OneConnect will employ to deliver the Combined System Development Services of Data Extraction and Searching System. Our approach is founded on the Agile methodology mandated by the Brief (Clause 4.1.2.h) and is designed to ensure the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards, meeting all of PlanD's performance requirements. The plan is practical, logical, and built upon proven best practices for managing complex AI system development projects.

9.1 Project Governance and Communication

Clear governance and transparent communication are the bedrock of our project management philosophy. This structure ensures all stakeholders are aligned, and decisions are made effectively.

● Project Governance Structure:
○ Project Manager (Single Point of Contact): Our dedicated Project Manager will act as the single point of contact for PlanD, responsible for the overall execution, coordination, risk management, and reporting for the entire project (both Part 1 and Part 2).
○ Project Steering Committee (PSC): We propose the formation of a PSC, co-chaired by the PlanD Government Representative and our Project Manager. The PSC will meet monthly to review progress against milestones, provide strategic direction, and resolve high-level issues.
○ Checkpoint Meetings: Bi-weekly checkpoint meetings will be held with PlanD's project team to discuss detailed progress, upcoming tasks, and resolve operational impediments.
● Communication Plan:
○ Monthly Progress Reports: Formal reports submitted to the PSC detailing progress, resource utilization, risks, and milestone achievement.
○ Sprint Review Meetings: Held at the end of every Sprint to demonstrate the "Done" software increment, gather feedback, and ensure the project is aligned with user expectations.
○ Agendas and Minutes: All formal meetings will have pre-circulated agendas and professionally documented minutes to ensure clarity and accountability.
○ Ad-hoc Workshops: As needed, we will facilitate technical or business workshops to deep-dive into specific requirements or resolve complex challenges.


9.2 Agile Methodology and Project Lifecycle

We will execute the project using the Scrum framework within an Agile methodology, ensuring flexibility, rapid delivery of value, and continuous alignment with PlanD's needs. The project will be structured into three main phases.

● Phase 1: Project Initiation and System Design (Months 1-2)
○ Objective: To establish a solid foundation and a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope.
○ Key Activities:
■ Project Kick-off Meeting: Formal commencement of the project with all key stakeholders.
■ Requirements Elaboration Workshops: Work with PlanD's Business Analyst and users to translate the Brief's requirements into a prioritized Product Backlog of User Stories.
■ System Design: Finalize the detailed technical architecture and produce the System Design Report deliverable as per Annex 1 of the Brief.
■ On-site Setup: Mobilize the on-site Data Preparation team and equipment at the NPGO.
● Phase 2: Iterative Development & Data Preparation (Months 3-11)
○ Objective: To incrementally build, test, and deliver the system while concurrently processing historical data.
○ Sprint-Based Execution: The development will proceed in a series of Sprints (fixed-length iterations of 2-4 weeks). Each Sprint is a self-contained mini-project that results in a high-quality, tested, and potentially shippable increment of the system.
○ Key Agile Events in Each Sprint:
■ Sprint Planning: At the start of each Sprint, the team selects a set of high-priority User Stories from the Product Backlog to complete.
■ Daily Scrum: A 15-minute daily stand-up meeting to synchronize activities and identify impediments. PlanD representatives are welcome to attend.
■ Sprint Review: A demonstration of the completed software increment to PlanD and stakeholders to gather feedback. This is the primary mechanism for ensuring the solution meets user needs.
■ Sprint Retrospective: An internal team meeting to reflect on the Sprint and identify process improvements for the next one.
● Phase 3: System Rollout, Nursing & Closure (Months 11-14)
○ Objective: To transition the system into production use and ensure a smooth handover.
○ Key Activities:
■ User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Provide full support to PlanD during the UAT phase.
■ Production Deployment: Deploy the finalized system to the production environment during a pre-agreed, low-impact maintenance window.
■ Training: Conduct comprehensive training sessions tailored to each user group (System Operators, General Users, Administrators).
■ System Nursing: Provide a 3-month free nursing period for intensive support and issue resolution.
■ Project Closure: Deliver all final documentation, conduct a post-project evaluation, and formally close the project.




9.3 Key Management Processes

To ensure the project remains controlled and on-track, we will implement the following key management processes.

2. Scope and Change Management:
2.1. The Product Backlog is the single source of truth for all requirements. All requested changes, including the estimated 30% modifications from the Brief (Clause 4.2.e.ii), will be managed as new items in the backlog.
2.2. The Project Manager and PlanD's Representative will prioritize the backlog regularly. This agile approach allows for controlled flexibility, ensuring that the highest value features are always being worked on, without uncontrolled "scope creep."
3. Quality Management:
3.1. Definition of Done: We will work with PlanD to establish a strict "Definition of Done" for each User Story, which will include development, peer code review, successful execution of all automated tests, and documentation updates.
3.2. Automated Testing: Our development process includes a suite of automated unit and integration tests that run continuously, ensuring new features do not break existing functionality.
3.3. Independent QAR: We will conduct independent Quality Assurance Reviews at key milestones (M4, M5, M11) as stipulated in the Brief, providing formal quality records to PlanD.
4. Risk Management:
4.1. We will maintain a Risk Register throughout the project lifecycle. Risks will be identified, assessed for impact and probability, and assigned mitigation strategies.
4.2. The register will be reviewed at every PSC meeting. Example risks include: unexpected complexity in historical document formats, dependency on third-party systems, or resource availability. This proactive approach ensures we are prepared for challenges rather than just reacting to them.

9.4 The Proposed Work Approach

9.4.1 A detailed description of how the Contractor is going to provide the required services
OneConnect’s proposed work approach is founded on an Integrated, Parallel, and Agile methodology. This ensures that the two main components of the project—Part 1 (System Development) and Part 2 (Data Preparation)—are executed concurrently. This synchronization is our key strategy to mitigate risks, maximize efficiency, and deliver a highly accurate and robust system that is trained and validated on real-world data from day one.

Our service provision is broken down into two synchronized workstreams:

Workstream 1: Part 2 - Data Preparation Services (The Foundation)
This on-site service at the North Point Government Offices (NPGO) is the foundational layer of the project. Its sole purpose is to convert PlanD’s vast repository of historical and current documents into a high-quality, structured, machine-readable format. Our approach is systematic and quality-focused:

1. Document Intake & Physical Preparation: Our on-site team, led by the Team Leader/Quality Checker, will collaborate closely with PlanD’s Document Sorting Assistant to manage the secure intake of document batches. We will perform meticulous preparation, including staple and clip removal, mending of torn pages, and sorting documents to ensure they are fit for scanning.
2. High-Fidelity Scanning & Imaging: Using our own state-of-the-art scanning equipment, we will digitize all documents at a minimum resolution of 300dpi. Our process includes automated duplex scanning, image enhancement, skew correction, and blank page removal to ensure the highest possible image quality, which is critical for the accuracy of the subsequent AI processing.
3. AI-driven OCR & Data Structuring: The digitized images and existing soft-copy documents will be processed by our sophisticated AI pipeline. This is a multi-stage process:
○ Vision Models will first perform layout analysis to identify structural elements like paragraphs, lists, and tables (even those with irregular or missing borders).
○ The OCR Engine, tuned for mixed English and Traditional Chinese text, will then convert the identified text zones into machine-readable format with a committed accuracy of at least 95%.
4. Quality Assurance (QA) and Secure Delivery: Every batch of converted data will undergo a multi-layered QA process involving both automated checks and human verification (Human-in-the-Loop) to validate accuracy against the source documents. Upon passing QA, the converted, structured data and associated index files will be securely delivered to PlanD’s Comprehensive Digitalised Document Repository (CDDR).
Workstream 2: Part 1 - System Development Services (The Engine)
This workstream runs in parallel to the data preparation service and focuses on building the core Data Extraction and Searching System.

1. Phase 1: Project Initiation and System Design (Months 1-2): We will initiate the project by conducting in-depth workshops with PlanD stakeholders to confirm business requirements, refine user stories, and finalize the detailed system architecture. This phase culminates in the submission of the System Design Report, which will serve as the technical blueprint for development.
2. Phase 2: Agile Development, Integration & Training (Months 3-10): Following the Agile Scrum methodology, our team will develop the system in a series of fixed-interval Sprints (e.g., 2-4 weeks). Each Sprint will deliver a potentially shippable increment of tested software. Crucially, the AI models developed in this phase will be iteratively trained and validated using the high-quality, structured data produced concurrently by Workstream 1. This ensures the AI is trained on real, relevant data, leading to a much more accurate and robust final system.
3. Phase 3: UAT, Rollout & Training (Month 11): We will configure the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment and provide comprehensive support to PlanD users during the UAT phase. Following successful UAT, we will manage the deployment of the system to the production environment and conduct dedicated training sessions for all user groups (General Users, System Operators, System Administrators).
4. Phase 4: System Nursing and Handover (Months 12-14): A three-month, free-of-charge system nursing period will commence upon formal acceptance of the system. During this time, our team will provide dedicated support to address any post-launch issues, optimize performance, and ensure a smooth and comprehensive handover to the ongoing System Maintenance & Support (SM&S) phase.
9.4.2 Any other standards and methodologies that the Contractor will adopt for this work assignment
In addition to the mandated Agile approach, OneConnect will adopt the following globally recognized standards and methodologies to ensure the highest levels of quality, security, and governance:

● Agile Software Development (Scrum Framework): We will strictly adhere to the Scrum framework as our chosen Agile methodology, in line with the DPO's "Practice Guide for Agile Software Development." This includes managing requirements in a Product Backlog, conducting standard Scrum events (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, Retrospectives), and using Agile tools for progress tracking and collaboration.
● Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK): Our Project Manager will apply PMBOK principles for overall project governance, including risk management, stakeholder communication, and quality management, providing a structured framework that complements the Agile delivery process.
● IT Service Management (ITIL v4): For the System Nursing and subsequent SM&S phases, we will adopt ITIL principles for incident management, problem management, and change control. This ensures that post-launch support is handled in a structured, efficient, and transparent manner.
● ISO/IEC 27001 Principles for Information Security: Our security measures and procedures are designed in accordance with the principles of ISO/IEC 27001 to ensure a robust Information Security Management System (ISMS) is in place to protect PlanD's data and assets.
 


9.5 Measures and Procedures to Comply with Project Management Requirements

OneConnect is fully committed to fulfilling all project management requirements as stipulated in Clause 4.1.2 of the Brief. The following table details the specific measures and procedures our Project Manager and team will implement to ensure compliance.

Combined System Development Services of Data Extraction and Searching System of TPB/PC Papers and Minutes for the Planning Department
9.7 Quality Assurance Plan

9.7.1 Introduction and Guiding Principles
OneConnect is fully committed to delivering a solution of the highest quality. This Quality Assurance (QA) Plan outlines the comprehensive methodologies, processes, and standards we will implement to ensure every deliverable—from the digitized data in Part 2 to the software modules in Part 1—meets or exceeds the requirements stipulated in the Brief of Work Assignment.

Our QA approach is governed by four key principles:

1. Proactive Prevention: Emphasizing thorough preparation and robust design to prevent errors before they occur, minimizing the need for rework and re-scanning.
2. Multi-Layered Verification: Implementing a series of automated and human-led checks at every stage of the lifecycle to ensure end-to-end quality control.
3. Continuous Improvement: Using feedback loops from our AI models and testing processes to iteratively enhance accuracy and system performance.
4. Transparency and Compliance: Maintaining clear documentation and adhering strictly to the acceptance criteria and standards defined by PlanD, including those in Annex B, Appendix I of the Brief.
9.7.2 Quality Assurance for Part 2: Data Preparation Service
To guarantee the accuracy and integrity of the millions of data points to be digitized, we will implement a stringent, multi-stage QA workflow. This process is designed to achieve the minimum 95% accuracy rate for converted textual content, as required.

● Stage 1: Pre-Processing Quality Control
Before any document is scanned, our on-site team at NPGO will perform a physical quality check. This includes reviewing document fitness, carefully removing staples and bindings, mending torn edges, and separating documents that are unsuitable for automatic feeders. This stage is crucial for ensuring high-quality scans and minimizing potential damage to original documents.
● Stage 2: Scanning and Image Quality Assurance
During digitization, automated QA checks will ensure that every scanned image meets PlanD’s standards. This includes verifying a minimum resolution of 300dpi, correct page orientation and sequence, and automated detection of severe skew or blurriness, aligning with the image quality criteria in Appendix I of the Brief.
● Stage 3: AI-Powered & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Verification
This is the core of our data quality process:
1. Automated AI Verification: After OCR processing, our system performs an initial automated QA pass. The AI checks for errors listed in Appendix I, such as wrong textual content (by cross-referencing against dictionaries and data patterns), misaligned tables, and text spanning across pages. Each extraction is assigned a confidence score.
2. Targeted Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review: Any data point with a low AI confidence score or involving complex elements (e.g., handwriting, dense tables, stamps overlapping text) is automatically flagged and routed to our on-site Quality Checker for manual review and correction. This ensures human expertise is applied efficiently where it's most needed.
3. Assessment Batch Evaluation: Before full-scale production, we will process the initial Assessment Batch (40,000 pages) and conduct an intensive internal audit to demonstrate that our workflow consistently achieves the 95% accuracy rate. Full production will only commence upon PlanD's formal confirmation.
● Stage 4: Batch Acceptance and Rectification
1. Internal Audit Check: Before submitting any production batch to PlanD, our Team Leader / Quality Checker will conduct a final comprehensive audit to verify accuracy and sequence.
2. PlanD Acceptance: We acknowledge and are prepared for PlanD's random checks on each production batch. We understand that acceptance is contingent upon finding NO errors from the Appendix I list during these checks.
3. Error Rectification: In the event that a document is rejected by PlanD, we commit to rectifying all identified errors—including re-scanning or modifying invalid textual content—at no extra time or charge, as stipulated in the Brief.
9.7.3 Quality Assurance for Part 1: System Development Service
Software quality for the Data Extraction and Searching System will be ensured through best practices integrated directly into our Agile development lifecycle.

● Agile Quality Integration:
1. Definition of Done: Each user story will have a strict "Definition of Done" that includes the completion of unit tests and successful peer code reviews.
2. Peer Code Reviews: All code will be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged to ensure it adheres to coding standards, is efficient, and is well-documented.
3. Continuous Integration (CI): We will use a CI pipeline to automatically build and run tests whenever new code is committed, allowing for the immediate detection of integration issues.
● Formal Testing Stages:
1. Unit Testing: Developers will be responsible for writing and executing unit tests for their individual code modules.
2. System Integration Testing (SIT): After each Sprint and before final delivery, our team will conduct comprehensive SIT to ensure all software modules, the AI engine, and the database interact correctly as a cohesive system.
3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Support: We will provide full support to PlanD during the UAT phase, including setting up the UAT environment, providing test data, and promptly resolving any identified bugs.
9.7.4 Quality Management Approach
As a core component of the Project Initiation Document (PID), our Quality Management Approach defines the comprehensive strategy for ensuring project quality. This approach will be formally agreed upon with PlanD at the start of the project and will govern all quality-related activities. It comprises:

● Quality Planning: The initial planning of quality is performed during the Initiation Stage (Month 1). It involves creating detailed Product Descriptions for all key deliverables (both data and system), defining their specific quality criteria and tolerances, and setting up the Quality Register and Issue Register.
● Quality Control: This involves the active measurement and inspection of products to ensure they meet the defined criteria. It includes the multi-layered verification process for the Data Preparation Service and the structured testing stages for the System Development Service.
● Tools and Techniques: We will utilize a combination of tools to manage quality effectively:
○ Project Management Platform (e.g., Jira/Confluence): To manage the Issue Register, track bugs, and maintain the Product Backlog.
○ Automated Testing Frameworks: For running unit tests and regression tests within our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
○ Custom HITL Verification Interface: The system's own interface for targeted manual QA of extracted data.
○ Version Control System (Git): To manage source code quality and peer reviews.
● Records: All quality activities, including reviews, tests, and approvals, will be formally logged in the Quality Register. All issues will be logged in the Issue Register.
● Reporting: Quality status, including summaries of QA activities, key issues, and resolution progress, will be a standing item in the bi-weekly Checkpoint Meeting minutes and monthly Highlight Reports submitted to the Project Steering Committee (PSC).
● Timing of Quality Activities: Quality checks are integrated throughout the project lifecycle, from daily code reviews and data checks to formal end-of-stage reviews like UAT.
● Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly defined roles for quality management are detailed in Section 4 of this plan.
9.7.5 Quality Control
Our Quality Control process is the active implementation of the Quality Management Approach. During the project, OneConnect will:

● Carry out Quality Methods: We will execute the full, multi-layered QA workflow as visualized in the QA Workflow Diagram. This includes pre-processing checks, image quality assurance, AI-powered verification, Human-in-the-Loop review, peer code reviews, and all formal testing stages (SIT, UAT).
● Maintain Quality and Approval Records: Every quality check, test result, and user acceptance sign-off will be formally documented and logged in the Quality Register to ensure a complete audit trail of the project's quality journey.
● Gain Acceptance from PlanD: We will present deliverables for formal acceptance by PlanD at the completion of each milestone. Acceptance will be based on demonstrating that the deliverable has met all predefined quality criteria documented in its Product Description.
● Eliminate Causes of Unsatisfactory Performance: We will use the Issue Register to not only track bugs but to identify patterns and root causes. Insights from this and from Sprint Retrospectives will be used to improve our processes and prevent the recurrence of issues.
9.7.6 Quality Management Products
To manage quality in a structured and transparent manner, we will establish and maintain the following key management products:

9.7.7.1 Product Descriptions
A detailed Product Description will be created for each key deliverable (e.g., "Digitised Data Batches," "Data Extraction AI Module," "Search User Interface"). Each description will unambiguously document:

● Purpose & Function: What the product is and what it does.
● Users: Who will use or benefit from the product.
● Quality Criteria & Tolerances: The specific, measurable standards the product must meet. Examples include:
○ For Digitised Data: "Overall accuracy rate for converted textual content must be >= 95%." "No errors from the Appendix I list found during random checks."
○ For the System: "System response time for a standard search query must be < 5 seconds." "UAT must have 0 outstanding critical or major defects."
● Quality Checking Method: How the product will be tested (e.g., Manual HITL review, automated regression testing, PlanD-led UAT).
● Quality Skills & Responsibilities: The personnel responsible for creating, testing, and approving the product.
9.7.7.2 Quality Register
This will be a master log used to summarize all planned and completed quality management activities. It provides a complete audit trail and will contain entries for every formal test and review, including:

● Quality Activity ID
● Product Name/ID
● Quality Check Method (e.g., SIT, UAT, Batch QA)
● Date Planned / Date Completed
● Result (Pass / Fail)
● Link to detailed records (e.g., Test Report, Issue Register IDs)
9.7.7.3 Issue Register & Change Control

● Issue Register: This register will be used to capture and maintain information on all bugs, problems, and off-specification issues identified during the project. It will include:
○ Issue ID, Issue Type (e.g., Bug, Off-specification), Date Raised, Raised By, Priority, Severity, Description, Status, and Date Closed.
● Change Control: If an issue is identified that has an impact on a baselined product specification (a Request for Change - RFC), it cannot be implemented unilaterally. A formal Change Request Form will be submitted to the designated Change Authority (the PSC) for approval. Once an RFC is approved, the relevant Product Description and acceptance criteria will be updated to reflect the change, ensuring PlanD signs off against the most up-to-date requirements.
9.7.7 Quality Management Roles & Responsibilities
Roles

Responsibilities

Project Manager

• Creates the overall Quality Management Approach within the PID.

• Establishes and oversees the Quality Register and Issue Register.

• Reviews the project's quality status and reports key findings in Highlight Reports.

• Manages the formal acceptance process with PlanD.

• Escalates critical quality issues and presents Exception Plans if tolerances are threatened.

System Analyst

• Leads the design and implementation of detailed quality procedures and processes.

• Creates detailed Product Descriptions, defining specific quality criteria and tolerances.

• Designs system and integration test plans.

• Conducts quality audits of both data preparation and software development outputs.

• Reviews and validates that bug fixes and rectifications meet requirements.

Development & Data Preparation Team

• Conducts unit testing and peer code reviews for all developed software.

• Executes the day-to-day quality control checks for the Data Preparation Service.

• Manages and updates the Issue Register with details of bugs and their resolution.

• Submits Change Requests for any required changes to baselined specifications.

• Supports the System Analyst and PlanD during formal testing stages (SIT & UAT).

• Is responsible for eliminating the causes of unsatisfactory performance at the technical level.

Internal quality assurance reviews will be done on a regular basis by us. The scope of these reviews is to ensure that:

● Project standards are in place and being complied with by the project team
● Ensuring that a quality plan is in place for the project and has been understood by the key project sponsor and team members.
The purpose of the Quality Review Plan is to set forth the key document-based deliverables of the project and define the following:

● Who is responsible for preparing the deliverable
● Who is responsible for reviewing the deliverable to ensure that it meets quality criteria
● What is the timing for production and for sign-off.
 

9.7.8 Quality Management Process diagram
To provide a clear and transparent overview of our commitment to quality, we have designed the following Quality Management Process diagram. This flowchart visually represents our end-to-end strategy, which is fully integrated into the project lifecycle. It illustrates how quality is planned, controlled, and reported from project initiation to final acceptance.

The process is broken down into three logical phases:

1. Phase 1: Project Initiation & Planning: Establishes the foundational rules, definitions, and tools for quality management before work begins.
2. Phase 2 & 3: Execution & Control: Details the iterative cycle of performing work, conducting rigorous quality checks, and managing any identified issues through a formal, auditable process.
3. Phase 3 & 4: Acceptance & Reporting: Shows the final path to deliverable acceptance, highlighting how continuous monitoring and formal reporting inform PlanD's final approval.
This structured approach ensures that every deliverable is subject to consistent standards, all issues are tracked and resolved, and PlanD has full visibility and control over the quality of the project at every stage.
 



9.7.8.1 Phase 1: Project Initiation & Planning
This initial phase is foundational to the entire quality framework. It ensures that quality standards are proactively defined and agreed upon with PlanD before development commences.

● The process begins at Start Project, leading to the creation of the high-level Quality Management Approach, which outlines the project's overall quality strategy and processes.
● Following this, two parallel streams are initiated:
1. The specific requirements for each deliverable are documented by creating detailed Product Descriptions. From these descriptions, a clear and measurable set of Define Quality Criteria & Tolerances is established. This ensures there is an unambiguous, shared understanding of what "done" and "high quality" means for every component.
2. The essential tools for tracking quality are established: the Setup Quality & Issue Registers. These registers will serve as the single source of truth for all quality checks and identified issues throughout the project.

 
 

9.7.8.2 Phase 2 & 3: Execution & Control (Iterative Cycle)
This diagram illustrates the core, iterative engine of our quality process, where all project work is executed and validated. This loop ensures that no deliverable proceeds without meeting its predefined quality standards.

● The cycle begins when Execute Project Tasks (such as developing a software module or preparing a data batch) is completed.
● The output immediately enters the Perform Quality Control stage, which includes code reviews, data QA, and testing.
● A formal decision gate, Product Meets Criteria?, determines the next step.
○ If Yes, the successful outcome is recorded in the Log 'Pass' in Quality Register, and the item proceeds toward final acceptance.
○ If No, the failure is logged, and a detailed entry is created in the Create Entry in Issue Register to ensure the problem is tracked until resolved.
● The logged issue is then analyzed at the Change Required? decision point.
○ If it is a simple defect that does not alter the agreed-upon specification, it is sent to Rectify & Re-test and re-enters the quality control loop.
○ If the issue requires a change to the baselined scope, a formal Submit Change Request Form is initiated. This request is reviewed by the Change Authority. If approved, the Update Product Description is amended to reflect the new requirement before the work is rectified. This formal change control process ensures all scope modifications are transparent and officially approved.



9.7.8.3 Phase 3 & 4: Acceptance & Reporting
This final section shows the culmination of the quality process, leading to formal acceptance by PlanD. It highlights the critical link between the ongoing quality control activities and the final approval decision.

● The workflow is divided into two parallel streams:
1. Deliverable Acceptance Path (Top Stream): A deliverable that has successfully passed all internal quality checks becomes Deliverable Ready for Formal Acceptance. It is then presented to PlanD for PlanD UAT & Acceptance. Upon successful completion, its status becomes Deliverable Accepted.
2. Oversight & Reporting Path (Bottom Stream): The Monitor Issue Register is a continuous activity. The status of all open and resolved issues is compiled and formally communicated via Report Quality Status in management products like Highlight Reports and presented at PSC Meetings.
● The crucial integration point is the arrow from Reporting to PlanD UAT & Acceptance. This signifies that PlanD's decision to accept a deliverable is informed by the transparent reporting on its quality status and any associated issues. Acceptance will only be granted when all critical quality criteria are met and any significant issues are resolved to PlanD's satisfaction.


 

 

 

 

 

9.8 Change Management Plan

9.8.1 Introduction and Objectives

This Change Management Plan defines the formal process for identifying, assessing, authorizing, and implementing any changes to the project's baselined scope, schedule, cost, or quality specifications. As this project will follow an Agile development methodology, this plan is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate iterative changes within Sprints while maintaining firm control over the overall project baseline.

The primary objectives are:

● To ensure all changes are systematically reviewed and approved before implementation.
● To assess the full impact of any proposed change on the project's timeline, budget, and deliverables.
● To maintain a clear and auditable trail of all changes.
● To ensure the Project Board and key stakeholders have full visibility and control over the project's direction.
9.8.2 Change Control Process

The diagram below illustrates our formal Change Control Process, which will be initiated for any issue that cannot be resolved within the agreed-upon stage tolerances (e.g., a simple bug fix) and requires a modification to a baselined product.



The process steps are as follows:

1. Issue Identification & Logging: Any team member or PlanD stakeholder can identify a potential issue (e.g., a new requirement, an off-specification finding). The issue is immediately logged in the Issue Register.
2. Initial Assessment & Impact Analysis: The Project Manager, in consultation with the System Analyst, will perform an initial assessment to determine the issue's priority, severity, and its potential impact on the project baseline (scope, time, cost, quality).
3. RFC Submission: If the issue requires a formal change to a baselined product (e.g., an approved System Design), a formal Change Request Form (RFC) is completed. This form will detail the change, justification, impact analysis, and recommended options.
4. Change Authority Review: The RFC is submitted to the designated Change Authority (the Project Steering Committee, PSC). The PSC will review the request and decide to Approve, Reject, or Defer it.
5. Planning & Implementation: If the RFC is approved, the Project Manager will update the Project Plan, schedule, and any relevant Product Descriptions. The change is then assigned to the development team for implementation.
6. Verification & Closure: Once implemented, the change is rigorously tested (as per the Quality Plan) to ensure it works as intended and has not introduced any unintended side effects. The RFC is then formally closed.
9.8.3 Change Management Products

● Change Control Approach: This document, part of the PID, will detail the full procedure, including scales for priority and severity, reporting requirements, and roles and responsibilities.
● Issue Register: A live log capturing all identified issues, including:
○ Issue ID, Issue Type (Request for Change, Off-specification, Problem/Bug), Date Raised, Raised By, Description, Priority, Severity, Status, and Date Closed.
● Issue Report: For significant issues, a separate Issue Report will be created to provide a detailed analysis, including root cause, impact assessment, and recommended solutions.
● Change Request Form (RFC): The formal document used to request a change to the project baseline, containing a full description, justification, and impact analysis.
 


9.9 Contingency Plan
As a core part of our Risk Management strategy, this Contingency Plan outlines the fallback procedures to be enacted should a significant risk materialize, threatening the project's progress or the stability of the live system.

9.9.1 Contingency Strategy

Our strategy is based on proactive identification and pre-planned responses. We will identify and assess all major risks during the Initiation Stage and log them in a Risk Register. For high-impact risks, we will define specific contingency actions.

9.9.2 Key Areas of Contingency Planning

● Data Preparation Service Contingencies:
○ Risk: Discovery of a large batch of historical documents in extremely poor condition, making them unsuitable for standard scanning.
○ Contingency: We have allocated a buffer in our timeline for manual, high-resolution flatbed scanning. We will immediately notify the Project Manager and, if the volume exceeds the buffer, present options such as re-prioritizing batches or requesting additional time from the PSC.
○ Risk: Major equipment failure (e.g., primary scanner breakdown).
○ Contingency: We will have a backup scanner on standby at our local office, ready for deployment within 24 hours to minimize downtime.
● System Development Contingencies:
○ Risk: A critical third-party component (e.g., an open-source library) is found to have a major security vulnerability.
○ Contingency: We will immediately isolate the component, activate our technical team to find a patched version or an alternative library, and present a remediation plan to the PSC via an RFC.
○ Risk: Key personnel unavailability (e.g., lead developer).
○ Contingency: Our internal project documentation and code standards ensure that knowledge is shared. We have other qualified developers on standby who can be brought onto the project within 3-5 working days to ensure continuity.
● Production System Fallback (Post Go-Live):
○ Risk: A major, unforeseen defect is discovered in the live production system immediately after deployment.
○ Contingency (Fallback Plan): We will implement a "blue-green" deployment strategy. This means we will maintain the previous stable version of the application in an inactive "standby" environment. If a critical failure occurs in the new version, we can re-route all user traffic back to the stable version in under 30 minutes, ensuring near-continuous service availability while we fix the defect in the new environment.

17. Project Dependencies, Limitations and Assumptions

Our proposal and project plan are based on a collaborative partnership with the Planning Department. The following dependencies, limitations, and assumptions are outlined to ensure a shared understanding and facilitate the timely and successful delivery of the final solution.

Dependencies on PlanD
Successful delivery is dependent on the timely provision of the following from PlanD:

● Access to Personnel: Timely access to the designated Government Representative for approvals, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for requirements clarification and UAT, and the Document Sorting Assistant for the data preparation workstream.
● Access to Facilities & Systems: Provision of the designated on-site facilities at North Point Government Offices (NPGO) for the Data Preparation Service, including secure storage. Timely access to the technical environment, including servers, the CDDR, and Active Directory for integration.
● Timely Feedback & Approvals: Provision of feedback and formal approvals for key deliverables (e.g., System Design Report, UAT sign-off) within the mutually agreed timeframe (typically 14 working days, as per the Brief) to maintain the project schedule.
● Quality of Source Documents: The completeness, legibility, and physical condition of the historical hardcopy documents provided for scanning will directly impact the speed and quality of the data preparation process.
Limitations of the Solution

● Scope: The scope of this project is strictly limited to the requirements detailed in the Brief of Work Assignment. Any new features or changes to baselined requirements will be subject to the formal Change Management Plan.
● Data Accuracy: We commit to achieving a minimum of 95% accuracy for the converted textual content. Achieving 100% accuracy is not feasible due to the variable quality of historical documents and the inherent limitations of OCR technology.
● AI Knowledge Boundary: The AI models will be expertly trained on the provided TPB/PC papers and minutes. Their knowledge and analytical capabilities are confined to this domain. The system will not have external knowledge or the ability to interpret information outside of the provided document corpus.
Key Assumptions
This proposal is based on the following assumptions:

● Availability of Key Personnel: We assume the key PlanD personnel identified in our plan will be available for workshops, reviews, and UAT as scheduled.
● Authenticity of Documents: We assume that all documents provided by PlanD are the authentic and correct versions. Our role is to digitize and extract data from them as-is; we are not responsible for validating the factual or legal correctness of the source content.
● Language: We assume the content of all documents is primarily in English and/or Traditional Chinese. The processing of other languages is not included in the scope of this proposal.
 


18. Potential Risks & Contingency Plan
We have identified potential risks to the project and have established corresponding mitigation strategies to ensure successful delivery. The following table outlines our risk management approach.

Risk Description
Likelihood
Impact
Level
Mitigation Strategy
Requirement Risk: Requirements change during the project, causing delays due to unplanned rework.

Low

Medium

• Formal Change Control: All new or changed requirements must go through the formal Change Control Process outlined in our plan.

• Clear Product Descriptions: Detailed Product Descriptions with agreed-upon quality criteria will be baselined at the start, providing a clear reference to prevent scope creep.

Integration Risk: The System experiences issues when integrating with PlanD's existing environment (e.g., Active Directory, SharePoint).

Medium

Medium

• API-First Design: The system is designed with a robust API layer to facilitate clean integration.

• Early Prototyping: Key integrations will be tested via proof-of-concept prototypes during the System Design phase.

• Collaborative Planning: We will work closely with PlanD's IT team from the start to plan and test all integration points thoroughly.

Resource Risk: A key OneConnect team member becomes unavailable for a significant period.

Low

Medium

• Knowledge Sharing: We enforce strict documentation and code commenting standards to ensure knowledge is not siloed.

• Succession Planning: We have identified backup personnel with the required skills who can be onboarded to the project within a short timeframe to ensure continuity.

Coordination Risk: Project activities conflict with other ongoing PlanD projects or dependencies.

Medium

Medium

• Proactive Communication: Our Project Manager will act as a single point of contact and will engage in frequent synchronization with other project teams.

• PSC Oversight: The Project Steering Committee will be used as a forum to identify and resolve any cross-project scheduling or resource conflicts.

Data Quality & Volume Risk: The quality of historical documents is significantly worse than anticipated, or the total volume exceeds initial estimates, impacting the data preparation timeline.

Medium

High

• Assessment Batch: Our use of an initial Assessment Batch (40,000 pages) is a key mitigation. It allows us to validate our scanning and QA speed on real documents and adjust our approach before committing to the full production run.

• Flexible Workflow: Our workflow includes provisions for manual handling and flatbed scanning for fragile documents, with a buffer built into our schedule for a certain percentage of such items.

Below are the sample entities selected from the data schemas for the Contractor to demonstrate that the proposed Business Analyst (BA) understands the business requirements at a high level,and the proposed System Analyst (SA) confirms that the A.I. solution can perform the extraction accurately.
⮚ Application No:A/YL-KTN/663
⮚ Application  Type: S.16 Application
⮚ Meeting No: 647th
⮚ Plan No: S/YL-KTN/9
⮚ Department:District Lands Officer, Yuen Long, Lands Department (DLO/YL, LandsD)
 
Departmental Comments
Aspect: Land Administration
View: He has no in-principle objection to the application subject to the following comments.
Departmental Comments:

● The Phase 2 site comprises 10 private lots which, by the terms of the Block Government Lease or Tai Po New Grants under which they are held, are demised as agricultural ground and adjoining Government land (GL), particularly GL Licences restricted to be used for agricultural, fish pond and erection of some structures, all in D.D. 107. Lot No. 1783 in D.D. 107 is subject to a Modification of Tenancy for erection and maintenance of some structures on site. The actual site area, land status and land holding details of the lots under application have to be verified at the land exchange stage if any land exchange is applied for by the Applicant to the LandsD. The Phase 1 site (i.e. Lot No. 1927 in D.D. 107) is held under New Grant No. 21263 dated 12.8.2011, under which is restricted to be used for any purpose other than for non-industrial (excluding godown, office, hotel and petrol filling station) purposes.
● His office is processing a land exchange to implement the Sha Po Development Phase 2 of an approved scheme under Application No. A/YL-KTN/118-2 and no binding contract for the proposed land exchange has been entered into. The site boundary of the Site in planning application is different from that approved under planning application No. A/YL-KTN/118-2.
● The private lots within the Site are owned by Bright Strong Limited, i.e. the applicant. The ownership particulars of the lots forming the Site have to be examined in detail at the land exchange application stage.
● The Site is subject to a maximum height ranging from 79mPD to 119mPD under the relevant plan for the Shek Kong Airfield Height Restriction. The height of the proposed development is about 62.2mPD. Although the height of the rooftop structures has not been indicated, it is envisaged that the proposed development would unlikely exceed the above height restriction.
● The proposed access road via the unnamed road to Castle Peak Road – Tam Mi and proposed road improvement works encroach onto land of various status, including but not limited to private lots, was considered under Application No. A/YL-KTN/604. Notwithstanding the access road proposed under Application No. A/YL-KTN/604 has been approved by the Board, he is not prepared to recommend invoking the relevant Ordinance for resumption of any private lots or creation of any rights for implementation of the proposed private development. His office reserves comments on the matter and any project interface with other proposed land exchange will be considered at the land exchange application stage, if any land exchange is applied for by the applicant to the LandsD.
● If planning permission is granted, the applicant has to apply to the LandsD for a land exchange to effect the proposed development. Such application will be considered by the LandsD acting in its capacity as a landlord at its sole discretion and there is no guarantee that the land exchange for the proposed development, including the grant of any additional GL, will be approved. In the event that the land exchange application is approved, it would be subject to such terms and conditions, including, among other things, the payment of premium and administrative fee, as may be imposed by the LandsD at its sole discretion.
 

 
Department: Commissioner for Transport (C for T)

The proposed development is compatible with the surroundings; provides public transport facilities and job opportunities; increases supply of medium/small-sized flats which could stabilise housing prices; reduces pressure to develop country park and the need of reclamation and increases greening area; is a suitable location for housing development and no adverse impacts on traffic, environment, visual and air ventilation; better utilisation of land resource; and improves local environment, hygiene and air-ventilation.
● adverse traffic impacts (including insufficient traffic capacity, illegal parking of construction vehicles and private cars since the development of Park Yoho, the junction of San Tam Road and Castle Peak Road – Tam Mi is heavily congested, blockage of pedestrian road and affecting pedestrian safety, etc.);
● adverse environmental, sewerage, drainage, visual, air ventilation and ecological (including impacts on birds, buffalo field nd wetlands; and heat island effect) impacts. Construction noise and dust nuisance will be severe and dumping construction waste will induce adverse impact to the river and the natural environment;
● piling works during the construction of Park Yoho causes damage to the village house in the nearby Sha Po Village, yet the developer delays the repair works;
● affect the fung shui and shrine of Shui Tau Tsuen and the rural living environment, and Yuen Long is over-developed already; and
● insufficient transport, recreational and educational facilities and road capacity in the area to serve the increased population. The existing road network and West Rail Line are already saturated.
The occupants of the proposed development would be subject to potential noise impact from train operation of the West Rail Line and approval conditions requiring the developer to incorporate and implement all appropriate noise mitigation measures at their own cost and to the satisfaction of DEP should be included.
 
Note: Ensure all inputted entities should match with the exact wording from the selected sample documents. Manual extraction is sufficient,no automated tools or programming are required.
 
 
 
Contractor's Declaration:
We confirm that we have reviewed the requirements referenced above and the proposed A.I. solution could extract the above information automatically without any hardcoding into the programs.
